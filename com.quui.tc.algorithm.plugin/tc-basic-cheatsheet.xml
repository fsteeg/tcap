		<description>Some basic stuff to consider...</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Move the chat area out of sight">
		<description>
			Seeing people submit solutions on the 500 pointer when I'm
			about to open it makes me terribly nervous.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Understand the problem">
		<description>
			Always understand what the problem is and how the examples
			work.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Find a solution on paper">
		<description>
			Find a solution on paper and write it down using pseudocode.
			This is very important, it greatly increases coding time...
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Code your solution">
		<description>
			Take your time, take doubts serious. Think it through before
			submitting. On longer numbers or words in the problem
			statement check for typos. Test for border cases like 0, ""
			max and min values.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Keep cool during challenge phase">
		<description>
			Keep cool, consider what you have, remember you can fail
			system test on solutions you think are ok. Don't get into
			the challenge fever, do no guessed, head over heels
			challenges.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Caveats: Parens, Doubles, API">
		<description>
			Be careful about parens (better more than less, for
			readability) and doubles , don't forget casting or using
			double literals. Don't forget the API : Comparable,
			arraycopy, split, Set, addAll, binarySearch and even stuff
			like Rectangle and Point.
