		<description>Some basic stuff to consider...</description>

	<item title="Set up an environment that allows you to focus">
		<description>
			For me, this means things like closing my mail client, and moving the chat area of the TC arena out of sight.

	<item title="Understand the problem">
		<description>
			Always understand what the actual problem is and how the examples work. Don&apos;t jump to previous sub-solutions to seemingly similar problems. Draft a solution for the problem on paper, as detailed as required.		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Implement your solution">
		<description>
			During implementation take your time, take doubts seriously. Think it through before submitting. On longer numbers or words in the problem statement check for typos. Test for border cases like 0, &quot;&quot; max and min values. Be careful about parens (better more than less, for readability) and doubles, don&apos;t forget casting or using double literals. Don&apos;t forget the API: Comparable, arraycopy, split, Set, addAll, binarySearch and even stuff like Rectangle and Point.Rectangle and Point.</description>

	<item title="Keep cool during challenge phase">
	  <description>
	    Keep cool, consider what you have, remember you can fail system test on solutions you think are ok (and end up with a negative score with an unsuccessful challenge). Don&apos;t get into the challenge fever, do no guessed, head over heels challenges. Instead challenge for a precise case that you understand, and that is not covered by the tests.</description>
